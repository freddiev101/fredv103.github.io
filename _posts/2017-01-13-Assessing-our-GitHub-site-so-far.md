    <td>I learned by using the marking scheme on Google Classroom that my teacher linked to formally assess my GitHub page so far with all of the posts in correct order. I also jotted down some improvements that I could make in my own time to my blogging site on GitHub.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to include some extra components on the checklist for my blogging site to enhance the quality and presentation of the summary of my I.T work so far in Year 9. I also need to focus on doing some extra work to make more progress with the framework of my small business.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I will add extra components to my website to better compliment my blogs that I have been set to post as a whole topic project. This could include things like a technical function that the viewer can interact with, or I could make other less technical improvements such as the colour co-ordination of my blog interface. I will also do some extra experimentational work on spreadsheets to add authenticity to my framework of my small business. </td>
